# LogTrack Application

## Overview

I created LogTrack as a personal project to help me stay organized and track my daily progress in coding, studying, and interview prep. I built this application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design is simple yet functional, featuring custom templates and a dynamic log entry system.

## What I Did

- **Built a Customizable Template System:**  
  I developed a flexible template builder that lets me define tracks, units, and fields to create a default structure. This serves as a starting point for every new log entry, but I can modify it as needed for that day.

- **Implemented Dynamic Log Entries:**  
  I created a system to add new log entries, where I can easily edit existing entries by clicking an edit button, updating the text directly in the form, and saving the changes. The saved display is cleaned up to show only the logged information without any interactive controls.

- **Integrated Cloud Saving:**  
  I used jsonbox.io for cloud storage so that my templates and log entries persist across sessions and devices without requiring any signup. This means I can access my data anywhere, whether on my computer or phone.

- **Enhanced UI Elements:**  
  I paid attention to details like making checkboxes larger and aligning them properly to fit the overall aesthetic. I also refined the layout to ensure that interactive elements (such as buttons) are both functional and visually pleasing.

## Why I Made These Choices

- **Simplicity and Accessibility:**  
  I wanted a solution that was easy to deploy via GitHub Pages without needing a complex backend. Using jsonbox.io allowed me to implement cloud saving quickly and without extra hassle.

- **Focus on User Experience:**  
  I designed the interface to be clean and modern with a dark theme and purple accents. This not only creates an appealing look but also minimizes eye strain during long study sessions.

- **Iterative Improvement:**  
  I continuously refined the app based on my own needs and feedbackâ€”ensuring that the tool remains flexible, useful, and easy to use as my requirements evolve.

## Next Steps

- **Advanced Search and Filtering:**  
  I plan to enhance the search functionality with more advanced filtering and sorting options.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Future improvements may include adding charts or graphs to provide visual insights into my progress over time.

- **Optional User Authentication:**  
  In the long run, I may implement a secure login system to allow personalized experiences, though the current focus remains on simplicity and ease of access.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Deploy on GitHub Pages:**  
   Push your code to the `main` branch, then go to your repository settings and enable GitHub Pages from the root of the main branch. Your LogTrack application will be available at the generated URL.

3. **Data Persistence:**  
   Both the template and log entries are saved via jsonbox.io, ensuring that your data persists across sessions and devices without any signup required.

I created this project to help me stay organized and track my progress, and I hope it can be useful to others as well. Enjoy using LogTrack!
